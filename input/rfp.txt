Comprehensive Data Analytics System Specifications
1. Introduction
The City of Charleston Police Department (CPD) is seeking proposals from qualified vendors to
provide a comprehensive data analytics system. This system will support our need for basic data
collection, robust data analysis, reporting, and visualization capabilities. The objective is to enhance
decision-making, optimize operations, and drive strategic initiatives through advanced data
analytics.
2. Background
This project is made possible by funding from U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice
Assistance (see attached grant solicitation). The goal of the project is to allow the CPD to collect and
visualize existing data from several, linked electronic sources in a user-friendly system that supports
and presents the agency’s problem-oriented policing efforts for both internal and external users.
Current deficiencies in CPD’s data collection and storage systems limit its ability to realize the
technological objectives of this grant-funded project. The CPD has many disparate datasets due to
state and local requirements that have created data silos. To overcome the analytical hurdles, the
CPD has implemented system and procedural changes to bridge the gap between datasets and link
them together. The department’s current challenge is performing consistent and swift data cleaning
and preparation, as well as product creation for both departmental and public stakeholders. These
processes are extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating latency, the potential for
variability, and a gap in access to data for stakeholders outside of its analytical unit. The goal is to
leverage this grant to create a comprehensive workflow that would incorporate data modeling to
assist with cleaning, product creation, and the publishing of dashboards and reports. This will allow
for further automation, better consistency, greater access, and increase the CPD personnel’s
capacity to spend more time analyzing data in-depth rather than simply compiling them.
